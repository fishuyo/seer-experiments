kinetrope

I am. The tree is.

We are both close enough, to see.

We push and pull each other.

We interact with technology every day as it is. There is a segementation, a split between our reality and the virtual realities we see on screens and in our devices. How do we become aware of this boundary. How do we become mindful of our own needs in interacting across this boundary. The economy of interaction cannot be balanced as long as part of our selves are not being addressed. We lose our body, or parts are neglected. I explore the possibility of full body interaction across the boundaries between worlds. In creating a world of simulated plant biology whose growth is drawn to the kinetics of other worldly bodies, specifically our bodies in our reality, a channel is opened. Not only does my body's motion through space affect the growth of these plants, but a relationship is development. I am moved by the growing tree. And it is moved by me.

Kinetrope is a plant-like lifeform born in virtual space, that grows towards the motions of a body in physical reality, and crosses the boundary of the virtual to meet the body face to face.
